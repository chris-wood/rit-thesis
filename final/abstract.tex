\begin{abstractpage}
This should be a short description of the work and the results: a paragraph 
or two summarizing your project. Note that abstracts are meant to be read 
independently from the rest of the project report so you cannot cite your 
paper or other papers in it. It would be useful to examine other abstracts 
in the papers you have read to understand what an abstract really is.
