The security of symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms is based upon Shannon's principles
of confusion and diffusion \cite{Shannon}. Confusion can be defined as the complexity of
the relationship between the secret-key and ciphertext, and diffusion is commonly referred
to as the degree to which the influence of a single plaintext bit is spread throughout
the resulting ciphertext. Traditionally, diffusion and consufion are achieved through linear
and nonlinear mathematical operations within the cipher, respectively. 

S(ubstitution)-boxes are the most common nonlinear building block of symmetric-key
block ciphers based on the substitution permutation network (SPN) design. 
We formally define a SPN design for symmetric-key block ciphers below. 

\begin{define}
Let $l$, $m$, and $N_r$ be positive integers, let $\pi_S : \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0,1\}^l$ be a permutation, and let $\pi_P : \{1,...,lm\} \to \{1,...,lm\}$ be a permutation. Let $\Pset = \Cset = \{0,1\}^{lm}$, and let $\Kset \subseteq (\{0,1\}^{lm})^{N_r + 1})$ consist of all possible key schedules that could be derived from an initial key $K$ using hte key scheduling algorithm. For a key schedule $(K^1, ..., K^{N_r + 1})$, we encrypt the plaintext $x$ using the following algorithm.

\begin{algorithm*}[t] %[htb]
\caption{SPN($x, \pi_S, \pi_P, (K^1, ..., K^{N_r + 1})$)} \label{spnAlg}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State $w^0 \gets x$
	\For {$r = 1 \to N_r - 1$}
		\State $u^r \gets w^{r - 1} \oplus K^r$
		\For	{$i = 1 \to m$}
			\State $v^r_{<i>} \gets \pi_S(u^r_{<i>})$
		\EndFor
		\State $w^r \gets (v^r_{\pi_{P(1)}}, ..., v^r_{\pi_{P(lm)}}$
	\EndFor
	\State $u^{N_r} \gets w^{N_r - 1} \oplus K^{N_r}$
	\For {$i = 1 \to m$}
		\State $v^{N_r}_{<i>} \gets \pi_S(u^{N_r}_{<i>})$
	\EndFor
	\State $y \gets v_{N_r} \oplus K^{N_r + 1}$
	\State \Return $y$
\end{algorithmic}
